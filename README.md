Welcome to the Å¸ HÅ¸PE! ðŸŽ‰

We're so excited for you to try our service and provide feedback about how it works.

### How to use this repository

We will be using this repository to centralize public feedback on the Å¸ HÅ¸PE service.

**[Discussions](https://github.com/yhype/yhype-feedback/discussions)** should be used as much as possible for questions, open discussions with other folks and general _discussions_ about particular features.

**[Issues](https://github.com/yhype/yhype-feedback/issues)** will be used to make formal announcements about feature additions and changes you can expect as we iterate on this feature.
